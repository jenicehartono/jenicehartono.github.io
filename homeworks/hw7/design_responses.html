						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As a psychology major, this article really interests me as it covers how desinging interfaces and how the human brain works overlaps. I learned the specific elements of the Gestalt Principle, and will be able to incorporate them into future designs. I also learned how everything ultimately plays into the concept of visual hierarchy and the message you want to convey to your user. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked how the article had a very clear structure which made it easy to follow, first explaining what the Gestalt principle is and then walking through each principle one by one. Moreover, I enjoyed how there are illustrations and examples in how they would look like in a real interface per principle. I think the article also used color really well to visualize the concepts better. </p>
