                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned how great Medium and other online platforms are for design inspirations. In particular, as a designer myself I have struggled to think about interesting or cutting-edge transitions in my UI, which is why I found this article insightful. I also learned how broad the range of inspiration I could get is, from the layout of the screens to the visual themes. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed how everything automatically played and looped, making it very easy to just scroll through and look at interaction designs. I also really liked the variety of different designed shown. However, I wish there was a way we could find a specific theme or product group to look at instead of a random selection of interactions that may not necessarily be relevant. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite is Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin. I really like how it wasn't too extra and was simple but still supporting a cohesive brand experience. All the interactions involved are very smooth and link to one another with the same transition types. I also like how they are able to make a simple product a lot more visually engaging just by using transitions. In particular, I like how they focused on 2-3 user interactions but really flushed them out to make it very appealling. </p>
