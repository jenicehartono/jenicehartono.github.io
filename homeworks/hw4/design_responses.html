						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned the importance of accessible design, which is backed up by specific design regulations which I find really interesting as it's important for designers to keep those in mind when creating work. Additinonally, I learned how accessibility stems beyond just color and also includes font size, additional text, etc. Overall, I learned to keep accessibility in mind with whatever design approach I take, ensuring interfaces cater to those of all abilities.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I really enjoyed how they include lots of external links to look more into related articles or specific rules or standards like WCAG. I also realized that the article itself follows accessible standards and uses typography principles we learned in class, making it overall enjoyable and easy to read. The images they added right below specific principles and points are also really helpful as they help visually the message that is being communicated a lot more easily.</p>
