			This is my personal website that has the goal of showcasing all my design-related work! I use it to recruit for product design opportunities, so it is mainly intended for recruiters to look at and view my work. I focused my wireframes on the landing home page that they will see, and I tried to make it easy to understand but catchy to make an impression through the design choices I made.

		<p>
			The problems my redesigns focused more on the visual information architecture of the landing page as I felt that there was too much information that could be cut as it is already stated in other pages of the website. I also added more call-to-action buttons to make it more intuitive and easier for the user to understand the different workflows they can access from the main page.
