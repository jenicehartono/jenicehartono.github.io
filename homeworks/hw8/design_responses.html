				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Dark pattern is something I've never heard of before, but as a UX Designer I think this topic is so important to ensure that you put your user's needs at utmost importance. This article taught me the many different ways that users can be tricked into doing something they don't want to do, and taught me how to avoid them in the future in my own personal experience as a user. I also learned that corporations may not always have their users' best interests in mind because they want to make profit at the cost of them.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I like how they used real life examples to compare dark patterns in UX with, like scams from physical printed credit card bills and spam emails. The real life example of l=Linkedin's lawsuit also really shined on how prevalant this issue is, even with products we use so often. Overall, I liked how the article addresses the prevalance of this issue really well.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind.</p>
					</li>
