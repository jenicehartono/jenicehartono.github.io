        Born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, I'm a product designer who loves to snack on cheese. Always eager to learn and grow, I strive to connect with people of every background by creating beautiful, universal, tech-driven solutions that empower people. In my free time, I like traveling, snowboarding, and playing with my 5 dogs back home!

        <li>As someone who comes from a design background, it was still interesting to see how they emphasized the most basic but important principals, such as visual hierarchy. I also learned how you can really breakdown every platform piece by piece from a UI/UX perspective.</li>
        <li>My favorite part about this article are the different GIFs for the difference products covered. I think it's a great way to visualize the hierarchy in very simple terms and manners, and illustrates the concept well.</li>
        <li>Know the rules, so you can break em.</li>
        <li>I give this article a 6.5/10! Although I like how it's concise and interactive with images, I think they could go in more depth into how this ties into more than just basic platforms, and how it connects to user experiences overall.</li>
