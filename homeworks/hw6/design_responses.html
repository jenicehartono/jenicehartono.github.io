						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> As someone who hasn't worked with very specific elements of animation, this article taught me just how many aspects there are. This includes the speed of animations and how it should be catered towards the user experience you're designing foor, like what elements or screen size. Moreover, I now realize that lots of transitions are guided by the timing of specific components, allowing them all to be combined in one cohesive animation. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Although this article was quite lengthy and had a lot of concepts, I really enjoyed the visual animations and graphs because it really helped illustrate the idea being conveyed to me. I also liked how they gave some context at the beginning into the importnce of animation. Moreover, they referred to specific sites that helps with common animation/transition patterns, which I think is very helpful. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Just like in ballet choreography, the main idea is to guide the userâ€™s attention in one fluid direction during the transition from one state to another.
