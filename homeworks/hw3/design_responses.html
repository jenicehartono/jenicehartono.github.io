        <li>Something I learned from this article is how complex typography is, from choosing the right sizes to pairing them nicely. Something that stands out to me is how choosing the right typography is a very case-by-case element, and choosing the right texts is all based on the message you want to convey. I also learned that there are combinations of fonts that are already proven to work well together, and that there is a golden ratio for font sizes.</li>
        <li>My favorite part of this article is how it was very easy to follow with all the supporting images to allow readers to understand what is actually being said about fonts really easily, and it was very easy to follow with the intuitive subheadings. I also really like how they include multiple hyperlinks for those who want to learn more about a specific part of typography or go to a specific resource. Overall, I like how informative yet simple the article is.</li>
        <li>"Typography is all about experimentation. Its both a science and an art."</li>
